Changing snap data file: In oder to read in your own data, download your snap data from Snapchat.com and find the provided text file with the amount of snaps sent to you. This should have a long txt file in it, with the date, time, and name of the person who sent you the snap. Note that half of the txt file is the snaps you sent, so deleting any snaps you have sent is crucial to achieve the desired result. Place this txt file into the same folder as the .java files and then within the 'snapVisualizer.java' file, change the name of the file to the one you chose in the section where the file is being read in (this should be commented for simplicity).
